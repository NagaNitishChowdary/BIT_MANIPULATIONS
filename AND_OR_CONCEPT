Given two numbers a and b 
if you perform "OR" and "AND" operations on them 

a + b = (a | b) + (a & b) 

the number of bits in a and b is equal to the numbers obtained on performing "OR" and "AND" operations on them 
but one number becomes big and another one becomes smaller (rearrangement of bits)
